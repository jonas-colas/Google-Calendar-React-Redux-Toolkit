### In this React App:
- I use Redux(RTK) as State management 
- You can add a new “reminder” (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time.
- The app will display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- The user can select a color when creating a reminder and the app will display it appropriately.
- It handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- You can edit reminders – including changing text, day and time & color.
- You can delete reminders as well.
- The Calendar support more than the current month and it is without any calendar library.
- For the css , I use tailwindcss
